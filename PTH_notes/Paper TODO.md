## Chapter Text
- [ ] **Introduction:**
	- [ ] Read about Erythropoiesis and modeling efforts to find better 
		- [x] basic biology 
			- stuff in folder understanding, direct citation
		- [ ] k_P_birth #model_extension 
		- [x] J_P_death representations(=hill function [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7606142/)) #model_extension 
	- [ ] read about malaria infection models, obviously Rebeccas stuff is good start
		- [x] look at immune responses or medication addition
	- [ ] read about PADH 
		- [x] what is the definition
		- [x] first formulation and hypothesis for this effect
- [ ] **Results:**
	- [ ] describe model and chosen parameters
		- [x] improve model .svg of rebacca
		- [ ] reaction equations
		- [ ] parameter table (markdown or pandas?)
			- just time parameters or k values?
	- [ ] Paragraphs and plots:
		- [x] 10% erythrocytes reduction show recovery
			- ![[E_reduction_10percent.png]]
		- [x] show 'normal' cyclic infection + medication
			- parameter set has to be slightly changed
				- tropism = 1, as it damps the oscillation to near none if higher >2
					- interesting discussion point
				- higher k_M_death  * 2 = 96 or could lower k_E_infect * 1/2
				- ![[Oscillation.png]]
		- [x] show infection +/- BH 
			- [ ] analysis of effect
	- [ ] Parameterscan and/or sensitivity analysis
		- [ ] interesting parameters risk factors plot in Rebeccas BA
			- [ ] find out if actually risk factors or just named so as they have big impact of dynamics
			- [ ] find clinical risk factors
				- [ ] factor connection to model parameter
- [ ] **Discussion:**
	- [ ] research reasons for bystander Haemolysis and model them
		- [ ] Haptoglobin incapable to buffer oiE substance release
			- [ ] ROS: degraded haemoglobin and artesunate
				- absent or low haptoglobin levels are a clinical parameter for finding PADH in Sawettachai Jaita et al., Post-Artesunate Delayed Hemolysis: A Review of Current Evidence,Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseas 2023 https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed8010049
				- in same publication artesunate is mentioned to suppress bone marrow precursor production 
			- [ ] release of surface proteins
				- [ ] what happens to oiEs at death
					- [x] digested by marcophage
					- [ ] disintegrate so release of substance has higher probability
			- [ ] include in model Haptoglobin #model_extension
		- [ ] immune system 
			- [ ] over priming of immune cells in response to infection?
				- [ ] short term cells of higher interest
			- [ ] build small immune response in model #model_extension 
- [ ] Appendix:
	- [ ] Sanity check graphs:
		- [x] oscillating infection 
		- [x] 10% decrease of erythrocytes to see recover to default, does erythropoiesis work?
