Known risk factor for BH: higher initial values lead to stronger BH. Reason for this effect is the higher particle number in the system. 
For Hct values lower then 0.4 there is no BH, this follows from lowered oiEs, and the J_oiE,d is to low to have a siginificant effect on Es.
Promising result in line with clinical observations that indicate that J_oiE,d and therefore BH are indeed responsible for PTH.
