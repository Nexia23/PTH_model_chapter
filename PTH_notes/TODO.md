- [x] Step function for Reti maturation time
	- [x] include in model
- [x] plot Fluxes of R and Ps to see where the low is 
- [ ] k_P_birth does have to be constant from steady state calc?
	- reti number low and idea was to fit this as other half life times are more known or already fitted in case of maturation time 
		- if estimator can guess better score
		- estimation result higher than calculated value
			-> 294 calculation vs. 356 pth or 385 non-pth
		- but stable state for Hb and all cell types way to high
	**-> logistic function or something implement?**
- [x] update [[Reaction Equations]] for hill function of P_death
- [ ] write pandas table for parameters of model or MD at least
