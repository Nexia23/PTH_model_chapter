- [x] Step function for Reti maturation time
	- [x] include in model
- [ ] k_P_birth does have to be constant from steady state calc?
	- reti number low and idea was to fit this as other half life times are more known or already fitted in case of maturation time 
	- it helps fitting if estimator can guess
	- estimation result higher than calculated value
		-> 294 calculation vs. 356 pth or 385 non-pth
