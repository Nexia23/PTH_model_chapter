- [x] Step function for Reti maturation time
	- [x] include in model
- [x] plot Fluxes of R and Ps to see where the low is 
- [ ] k_P_birth does have to be constant from steady state calc?
	- reti number low and idea was to fit this as other half life times are more known or already fitted in case of maturation time 
		- if estimator can guess better score
		- estimation result higher than calculated value
			-> 294 calculation vs. 356 pth or 385 non-pth
		- but stable state for Hb and all cell types way to high
	**-> logistic function or something implement?**
- [x] update [[Reaction Equations]] for hill function of P_death
- [ ] write pandas table for parameters of model or MD at least
- [ ] improve Data analysis
	- [ ] divide patient groups by descent and/or immunity 
- [ ] change Parameters:
	- [ ] infection is too fast and strong
		- [ ] patient take longer to come to clinic:
			- [ ] longer pre time ~10 days or longer
		- [ ] lower parasitemia after pre_time days ~1% max. 3%
			- [ ] possibly start with lower M_init 
			- [ ] lower infection rate
	- [ ] higher RPI, thus higher Reticulocytes
		- [ ] parameter scan Hkt_init
		- [ ] check Hb influence on J_P_death, maybe has to be stronger?
		- [ ] check steady state calculation for Retis
			- [ ] set manually higher, by extra factor 
	- [ ] longer oiE life span
- [ ] read about immune system reaction to PS and anitPS, could be reason for immune answer
