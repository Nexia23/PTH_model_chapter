- [x] Step function for Reti maturation time
	- [x] include in model
- [x] plot Fluxes of R and Ps to see where the low is 
- [ ] k_P_birth does have to be constant from steady state calc?
	- reti number low and idea was to fit this as other half life times are more known or already fitted in case of maturation time 
		- if estimator can guess better score
		- estimation result higher than calculated value
			-> 294 calculation vs. 356 pth or 385 non-pth
		- but stable state for Hb and all cell types way to high
	**-> logistic function or something implement?**
- [x] update [[Reaction Equations]] for hill function of P_death
## Chapter Text
- [ ] **Introduction:**
	- [ ] Read about Erythropoiesis and modeling efforts to find better k_P_birth and J_P_death representations #model_extension 
	- [ ] read about malaria infection models, obviously Rebeccas stuff is good start
		- [ ] look at immune responses or medication addition
	- [ ] read about PADH 
		- [ ] what is the definition
		- [ ] first formulation and hypothesis for this effect
- [ ] **Results:**
	- [ ] describe model and chosen parameters
		- [ ] improve model .svg of rebacca
		- [ ] reaction equations
		- [ ] parameter table (markdown or pandas?)
			- just time parameters or k values?
	- [ ] Paragraphs and plots:
		- [ ] show 'normal' cyclic infection + medication
		- [ ] show infection +/- BH 
			- [ ] analysis of effect
	- [ ] Parameterscan and/or sensitivity analysis
		- [ ] interesting parameters risk factors plot in Rebeccas BA
			- [ ] find out if actually risk factors or just named so as they have big impact of dynamics
			- [ ] find clinical risk factors
				- [ ] factor connection to model parameter
- [ ] **Discussion:**
	- [ ] research reasons for bystander Haemolysis and model them
		- [ ] Haptoglobin incapable to buffer oiE substance release
			- [ ] ROS: degraded haemoglobin and artesunate
				- absent or low haptoglobin levels are a clinical parameter for finding PADH in Sawettachai Jaita et al., Post-Artesunate Delayed Hemolysis: A Review of Current Evidence,Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseas 2023 https://doi.org/10.3390/tropicalmed8010049
			- [ ] release of surface proteins
				- [ ] what happens to oiEs at death
					- [x] digested by marcophage
					- [ ] disintegrate so release of substance has higher probability
			- [ ] include in model Haptoglobin incapable to buffer #model_extension
		- [ ] immune system 
			- [ ] over priming of immune cells in response to infection?
				- [ ] short term cells of higher interest
			- [ ] build small immune response in model #model_extension
