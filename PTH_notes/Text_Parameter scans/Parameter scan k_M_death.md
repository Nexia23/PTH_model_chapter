Governs survival time of M $J_{M,d}=k_{M,d}* M$ the lower the value the longer are merozoites alive. 
Graphs follow similar pattern as k_E_infect, makes sense as both govern the dynamics of merozoites, if M survive longer, changes are that they infect an E or R.
Again there is a sweet spot in which both sinks for Hct are distinct and the second is lower than the first. basically moving from low values = infecting the whole system to high values= infecting nearly none.
