Is calculated for the healthy steady state, thus if changed healthy state values for species change. 
The higher the value the higher the particle number in the system. Naive assumption is that similar dynamics as Hct_init variation are expected and they are. Differences are from the now wrong initial steady state calculations and the fact that more cells are produced second peak in R and P. LDH values higher because more Ps are produced and thus more R, which so more infection and death can happen
