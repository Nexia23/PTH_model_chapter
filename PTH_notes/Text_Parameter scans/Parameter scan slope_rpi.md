The parameter governs the steepness of the step function built to represent the measured changes in R maturation time depending on the current Hct. With values of ~ 100 leading to more step-like behavior. 
The slope changes the dynamics of R significantly. It is also included in the healthy steady state calculation, thus the slight changes in J_P_birth and subsequently P.  Lower slope values lead to longer maturation of Rs after medication, see second figure. As the Rs mature longer and at the same time even more Rs are produced, the rise in Rs after medication seems plausible, also explains the stronger drop of HB and Hct values.
