An increase in the parameter for P maturation leads to higher values P as is seen as half life time.
The lower the t_mat the more pronounced is the effect of BH. Even the LDH level drops lower than set steady state value between 30-50 days post medication else only seen in a_P_d. The ripple effect on the system by this parameter variation is intriguing. The LDH values do not change much though the E drops by 500000 more cells, at the same time less Rs are in the system slightly compensating this change but that should not be enough
With higher t_mat the P dynamic reacts more to introduced events like the infection and later the side effect of ACT. E behaves in the opposite direction. Which indicates that a higher value could lead to a more robust system. 

Illustrating that a certain maturation time seems beneficial for systems which require flexibility (to respond) and robustness (return to norm) in case of perturbations.
