T_E_death is the half life time of the E species, a change here introduces variation in the healthy steady state calculation by increasing J_P_birth as Es die faster, a faster production pipeline is required for the same Hct value, leading to overall higher R and P values.
Interestingly, higher t_E_death values lead to less pronounced sinks in the Hb, Hct and E graphs, but at the same time the minimum is lower. Here maybe a biological tread off could be at play, kill more cells for faster recovery but this should require more reproduction?
#TODO coupled parameter scan with Hct?
