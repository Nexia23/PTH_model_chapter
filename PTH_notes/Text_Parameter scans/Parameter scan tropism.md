Tropism decides the difference in infection rate between Rs and Es, with higher tropism the rate for R infection increases.
High tropism leads to no Rs and higher overall parasitemia, as more cells are infected. Also the the second sink in the E graph is less visible. As the infection lowers the Hct values sharply, the system produces more P and thus Rs to compensate after the medication, BH has probably no big effect as the repopulation fluxes for R and Ps compensate the BH death flux.
