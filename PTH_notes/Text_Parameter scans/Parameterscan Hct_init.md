Known risk factor for BH: higher initial values lead to stronger BH. Reason for this effect is the higher particle number in the system. 
For Hct values lower then 0.4 there is no BH, this follows from lowered oiEs, and the J_oiE,d is to low to have a siginificant effect on Es.
Promising result in line with clinical observations that indicate that J_oiE,d and therefore BH are indeed responsible for PTH.
**General Observations**:
- **Higher Initial Hct**: Leads to stronger responses in most parameters, with sharper increases and more pronounced peaks. Recovery tends to be slower, and there's a secondary peak in some cases (e.g., Hb, LDH).
- **Lower Initial Hct**: Results in delayed and less pronounced responses, with faster reductions post-treatment and generally quicker recovery to baseline levels.
**Observations**
1. **Parasitemia (%)**:
    - The curves start at zero and rise sharply, reaching a peak before declining, indicating the progression and eventual control of parasitemia over time.
    - Lower initial hematocrit (Hct) values tend to show a delayed rise and lower maximum parasitemia compared to higher initial Hct values.

2. **Infected Erythrocytes:
    - The curves show a rapid increase in the count of infected erythrocytes, peaking at same time just before medication start.
    - Lower initial Hct values generally lead to a delayed rise with a lower maximum compared to higher Hct values.
    - Following the peak, the count of infected erythrocytes declines as the treatment takes effect.

3. **Once infected Erythrocytes**:
    - The curves for uninfected erythrocytes initially close to zero as parasitemia rises, indicating no conversion of infected to once infected erythrocytes.
    - Sharp rise to maximum with addition of medication as treatment reduces parasitemia and the body produces once infected erythrocytes.
    - The curves begin to reduce again to zero, with higher initial Hct values leading to longer survival.
    - Lower initial Hct values show a less pronounced peak and a faster reduction.

4. **Erythrocytes**:
    - The erythrocyte curves have an initial decline due to infection and subsequent recovery after treatment.
    - The depth of the decline and the rate of recovery vary with the initial Hct value, with higher Hct values showing a steeper decline and slower recovery.

5. **Reticulocytes**:
    - Reticulocyte curves initial remain constant, at the time of treatment depending on the initial Hct value the curve rises steeply for higher Hct or sinks first before rising. 
    - After medication as the body attempts to compensate for the loss of erythrocytes and R by producing more immature red blood cells.
    - The peak and subsequent decline reflect the dynamic response to its treatment.
    - Lower initial Hct values exhibit a less pronounced increase compared to higher Hct values.

7. **Precursors**:
    - P counts generally increase following infection, reflecting the impact of the infection on P production and destruction of Hb containing cells.
    - The curves for different initial Hct values show varying depths of decline after medication but all sink to zero
    - The rates and strengths of recovery as response to this fall vary, with higher initial Hct values showing a more significant rise to higher maximal values.
    - Before decreasing to the systems specific steady state value

8. **J_P_birth:**
	- Higher initial Hct values exhibit a higher constant birth rate
9. **Hemoglobin (Hb, g/dl)**:
    - Hemoglobin curves show a decline as parasitemia increases, corresponding to the destruction of erythrocytes.
    - The decline is followed by a gradual recovery during and after treatment, with the extent of the decline and recovery rate dependent on the initial Hct value.
    - High initial Hct values have a second sink from around 12-15 days, before complete recovery  

10. **Hematocrit (Hct)**:
    - same dynamic behavior as Hb since both values are dominated by the E and R amount  
    - Hematocrit levels decrease as the infection progresses and erythrocytes are destroyed.
    - The curves show a recovery phase as new erythrocytes are produced and the infection is controlled.
    - Higher initial Hct values exhibit a more significant drop and slower recovery.

11. **Reticulocyte Production Index (RPI)**:
    - The RPI curves indicate an increase in reticulocyte production as a response to anemia induced by infection and medication.
    - similar dynamics as R count
    - The index peaks and then gradually declines as the infection is brought under control and erythrocyte levels stabilize.
    - Lower initial Hct values drop first after treatment before showing a less pronounced peak compared to higher Hct values.

12. **Lactate Dehydrogenase**:
    - LDH levels increase slowly during infection, reflecting hemolysis.
    - The curves peak and then decline as the infection is treated and tissue damage decreases. Higher initial Hct values show a more pronounced second peak when compared to lower initial Hct values, where this peak nearly disappears.
    - Lower initial Hct values show a lower peak LDH level compared to higher initial Hct values.

In summary, the lower the initial hematocrit value, the less severe the initial impact of infection appears to be in terms of parasitemia, infected erythrocytes, and LDH levels, but the recovery tends to be in the same time range. Conversely, higher initial hematocrit values show a more pronounced impact but a quicker and stronger response.
