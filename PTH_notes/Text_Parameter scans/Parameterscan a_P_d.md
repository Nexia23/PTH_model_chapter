a_Pd is the scale in the hill function for Hb influence on Precursor death, $h(Hb)= (\frac{a_{P,d}} {1 + k_{P,d} * Hb^{r_{P,d}}})^{-1}$. 
$h(Hb)$ has the role of EPO .
The bigger a_P, the Hb influence on survival of Ps wanes, thus slower response to infection event, lower and slower values of R .
For steady state calculation influence on J_P_death thus also on J_P_birth. Higher J_P_birth thus higher P values as stronger response to infection and death by ACT therapy. More complex looking graph
