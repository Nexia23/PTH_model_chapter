- What if the mean life time of healthy red blood cells changes with parasite burden?
	- implemented as event it does work well, cost function worse and without event, also the graphs look bad
- Should P birth and death be more dynamic? 
	--> Hill function for regulation of J_P_death
	- run delay model has nice graphs but unrealistically high fluxes, here either ignore and claim ignorance or unknown regulation
	- or see if the difference is all that matters $\Delta_{birth-death}=$  500, estimation finds other values

- Found a paper Plasmodium falciparum rhoptry protein RSP2 triggers destruction of the erythroid lineage, this instead of haptoglobin as trigger or together

- Most #tropism studies on _P. falciparum_ agree that it has the capability to invade both reticulocytes and normocytes but prefers reticulocytes when available ([Table 1](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1022828/full#tab1)). Varying extents of its reticulocyte preference were reported: from as low as 2 times more ([Pasvol et al., 1980](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1022828/full#ref121); [Naidu et al., 2019](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1022828/full#ref105)), to as high as 14 times more ([Hegner, 1938](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2022.1022828/full#ref53)) than its normocyte preference
- data for EPO fitting [here](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1511160/) sadly not the found the paper yet
