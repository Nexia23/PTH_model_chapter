This is a _hypoproliferative_ anemia, with MCV and RDW usually within normal limits, and which typically affects all peripheral blood elements (red cells, white cells, and platelets â€“ see below). Immature white cells and red cells are not usually present on peripheral blood films. Bone marrow biopsy is commonly performed to obtain the diagnosis and typically shows severely hypoplastic/aplastic marrow with severe depletion of all hematopoietic marrow precursors. Aplastic anemia may be primary/inherited or secondary/acquired, with the latter due to chemical toxin, infection, radiation, or immune dysfunction. Serum iron may be elevated, due to lack of erythropoiesis. The typical hematological findings in this condition are summarized in entry 4 of Table 8-1 . Importantly, none of the quantitative serum diagnostic tests for hemolytic anemia, such as haptoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin, and indirect bilirubin elevation, are positive in this condition.
