 **Destruction**

The erythrocyte gradually undergoes metabolic changes over the course of its 120-day life span, at which time the less viable senescent cell is removed from the circulation. Certain glycolytic enzymes diminish in activity as the cell ages. Older red cells have a smaller surface area and an increased mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) compared with younger cells. Furthermore, aged red cells lose sialic acid from their membranes, exposing an asialoglycophorin. This senescent antigen is recognized and an autoantibody is synthesized by the host. After the binding of the autoantibody, the senescent cell is removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system, primarily within the spleen. About 3 million cells are normally removed from the blood per second without any demonstrable histologic evidence of erythrophagocytosis.

In some pathologic states, the reticuloendothelial system removes younger sensitized or abnormal red cells at a rapid rate. Subsequently, erythrophagocytosis is often evident. In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the reticuloendothelial system removes red cells following the binding of autoantibodies or complement to reticulocytes and young red cells. In other pathologic states, red cells are removed because of structural defects that interfere with their normal passage through microcirculation of the reticuloendothelial system.
