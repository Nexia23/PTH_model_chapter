## Haptoglobin biological functions
from [Masi et al. 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#sec6)
Hp is a detoxifier of Hb that is released during red blood [cells lysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cytolysis "Learn more about cells lysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") within the vascular compartment ([Alayash et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib9)). Under physiological conditions, Hb is bound and stabilized by Hp and subsequently cleared from circulation by the macrophage-specific receptor CD163 ([Kristiansen et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib244)). This receptor is expressed by cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, and particularly in red pulp macrophages of the spleen and liver [Kupffer cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/kupffer-cell "Learn more about Kupffer cells from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kristiansen et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib244); [Kaempfer et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib223); [Alayash et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib9); [Etzerodt et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib153); [Durnford et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib142)). Thanks to the high concentration of circulating Hp, the plasma compartment has the capacity to neutralize several grams of Hb under a sudden hemolysis. However, under certain hemolytic conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, malaria, crash syndrome, and severe infections, serum Hp is depleted leading to accumulation of free Hb in plasma. In these cases, besides the CD163 pathway, the [phagocytosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/phagocytosis "Learn more about phagocytosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of senescent red blood cells by M2-type macrophages allows the lysosomal degradation of Hb and the heme catabolism by [heme oxygenase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/heme-oxygenase "Learn more about heme oxygenase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Etzerodt and Moestrup, 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib151)). However, the CD163-mediated [endocytosis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/endocytosis "Learn more about endocytosis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of the Hp:Hb complex may take place in a broader subset of macrophages than those responsible for red blood cells uptake (mainly in spleen and bone marrow) because the Hp:Hb complexes have better access to macrophages in the extravascular tissues ([Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)).

As a whole, the main functions of Hp in Hb metabolism are: (i) Hb clearance, (ii) heme detoxification, and (iii) the maintenance of Hb in the low radical-inducing reduced state ([Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)). Indeed, Hp limits Hb access to environments where heme release, [oxidative stress](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/oxidative-stress "Learn more about oxidative stress from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and NO-dependent reactions are much more likely to occur and may finally lead to the events associated with Hb toxicity, such as renal failure and vascular injury ([Gladwin et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib175)) ([Fig. 8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#fig8)).

Fig. 8. The intravascular hemolysis of the red blood cells causes the release of HbO2, which is bound by Hp. The Hp:Hb complex binds to the CD163 receptor expressed by macrophages of the reticulo-endothelial system. After endocytosis, Hp and apoHb are degraded, the heme is either oxidized by heme-oxygenase-1 or recycled, and the CD163 receptor is recycled from the endosomes back to the plasma membrane. During hemolysis, the plasma heme is trapped by the HDL/LDL/albumin/hemopexin rescue pathway. The PDB entry of the heme-hemopexin complex is [1QJS](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore.do?structureId=1QJS)

([Paoli et al., 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib324)). Then, the hemopexin:heme complex binds to the CD91 receptor; both the CD91 receptor and hemopexin are recycled whereas the heme is either oxidized by heme-oxygenase-1 or recycled.

### Haptoglobin-dependent regulation of hemoglobin metabolism

The Hb release into the blood is a natural phenomenon that occurs at a rate of 2 × 106 red blood cells per second during the turnover of senescent cells ([Ascenzi et al., 2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib30); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368)). The [Hb levels](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/hemoglobin-blood-level "Learn more about Hb levels from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in blood increase in a wide range of disease states and clinical interventions, including genetic and acquired anemias (_e.g._, sickle cell disease, burns, extracorporeal circulation, and massive blood transfusion). The release of Hb can also result from intravascular hemolysis accompanying diabetes, infectious disease, trauma, and cancer. Hb toxicity largely depends on the rate of hemolysis, the tissue oxidant status and the clearance capacity ([Kato, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib229); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368); [Irwin et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib215)).

Following the release from red blood cells, extracellular Hb undergoes [dimerization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/dimerization "Learn more about dimerization from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Ackers and Halvorson, 1974](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib4)); this process is favored by low serum Hb concentration and by its ferrous oxygenated state. After Hb release in the circulation, dimeric Hb is sequestered by Hp, preventing the renal filtration and limiting the diffusion of free Hb into the intracellular space between endothelial cells and the vascular smooth muscle layer. Therefore, when Hb is bound to Hp the oxidative damage of cells and tissues is prevented ([Kato, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib229); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368); [Irwin et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib215); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)).

The abundance of anti-oxidants, like [ascorbic acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ascorbic-acid "Learn more about ascorbic acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and urate in plasma as well as the presence of Hp, stabilizes Hb in a reduced state, thus impeding Hb to participate in [oxidative reactions](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/aerobic-metabolism "Learn more about oxidative reactions from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") that usually cause the formation of Hb(III) and the release of free heme ([Butt et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib87); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)). It should be also noted that the heme-Fe atom participates to the Haber-Weiss reaction in which, according to Fenton chemistry, reactive oxygen species (_e.g._, superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) are converted to more powerful species (_e.g._, hydroxyl radical) both initiating and amplifying [lipid peroxidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipid-peroxidation "Learn more about lipid peroxidation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"); among others, this contributes to the development of diabetes and atherosclerosis ([Bresgen and Eckl, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib78)).

Hb dimers, if not bound to Hp, are rapidly filtered by the glomerulus and cleared by the kidney thanks to their small molecular mass compared to tetrameric Hb ([Murray et al., 1961](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib299); [Andersen et al., 1966](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib14); [Boretti et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib72)). Indeed, the large Hp:Hb complex cannot be filtered by the kidney and _in vitro_ translocation across endothelial monolayers is almost completely impaired ([Lipiski et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib268)). Of note, the [autoxidation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/autooxidation "Learn more about autoxidation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of Hb dimers proceeds with a rate constant 16-fold faster than that of tetrameric Hb ([Griffon et al., 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib180)). Indeed, after translocation into the extravascular space, Hb encounters severer oxidative conditions than in plasma that can be particularly exacerbated under pathological conditions leading to lowering pH. Noteworthy, while the level of Hb(III) usually remains below the level of detection in plasma, a large fraction of excreted Hb appears in the urine in the ferric form, which depends also on the acidic pH of urine ([Boretti et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib72)).

The half-life of Hp:Hb complexes in the circulation may depend on the degree of hemolysis. In humans the half-life of Hp:Hb amounts below the [maximum clearance](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/maximum-clearance "Learn more about maximum clearance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") capacity is ~10–30 min ([Laurell and Nyman, 1957](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib251); [Garby and Noyes, 1959](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib168); [Keene and Jandl, 1965](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib232)). However, the injection of Hp-saturating amounts of Hb in humans causes an Hp half-life of several hours. Such a dose-dependency of the clearance rate indicates that the clearance of Hp:Hb occurs via a saturable system in accordance with receptor-mediated uptake of Hp:Hb ([Laurell and Nyman, 1957](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib251); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)).

The clearance and endocytosis of the Hp:Hb complexes follows a biphasic time-course. The first phase takes place in normal condition when the levels of free Hb are low, whereas the second phase happens when the levels of free Hb increase as a consequence of tissue injury or hemolysis ([Schaer et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib365)). In the first phase, the Ca2+-dependent recognition of the Hp:Hb complexes by macrophages is mediated by the CD163 receptor. Since the Hp:Hb recognition from CD163 requires several binding sites of Hp, the multimeric [quaternary structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/protein-quaternary-structure "Learn more about quaternary structures from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of Hp2-1 and Hp2-2 phenotypes favor a stronger binding of the Hp:Hb complexes to CD163 compared to the Hp1-1 phenotype ([Kristiansen et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib244); [Graversen et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib178); [Schaer et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib365), [2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367)). The endocytosis of Hp:Hb complexes is followed by the lysosomal [proteolysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/protein-hydrolysis "Learn more about proteolysis from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of Hb and heme metabolism by heme oxygenase-1 leading to the formation of CO, Fe(III), and biliverdin/bilirubin ([Wagener et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib434)). The Fe(III) ion can be recycled to produce heme-proteins and/or Fe-S-containing proteins. Of note, the CD163 pathway is upregulated during the [acute phase response](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/acute-phase-response "Learn more about acute phase response from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") since IL-6 stimulates the expression of Hp, CD163 and heme oxygenase-1 ([Moestrup and Moller, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib291)). The CD163-dependent clearance of Hp:Hb induces the anti-inflammatory response, because the elimination of the pro-inflammatory Hb promotes heme catabolism and thus the generation of CO and [bilirubin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/bilirubin "Learn more about bilirubin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), two well-known anti-inflammatory metabolites ([Gullotta et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib182); [Heinemann et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib196); [Wegiel et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib442)). Note that the expression of CD163 is induced by inflammation and by the release of cytokines (_e.g._, IL-1 and IL-6) and is downregulated by TNF-α, IL-4, and IFN-γ ([Gordon, 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib177); [Etzerodt et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib152), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib154); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367), [2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib368)). In the second phase, the Hp-binding capacity is depleted and a Hp-independent interaction between Hb and CD163 takes place at the _C_-terminus of the Hb β chains ([Lim et al., 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib262); [Schaer et al., 2006a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib363), [2006b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib364); [Buehler et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib82)). This reflects the fact that Hp is not recycled after delivering Hb to the liver, leading to a progressive decrease of the Hp concentration in plasma ([Van Vlierberghe and Delanghe, 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib426)).

### Haptoglobin-dependent anti-oxidant effects

The major problem connected to the release of Hb from red blood cells is related to the oxidative properties of the heme-Fe atom, which can be oxidized in the presence of H2O2 ([Alayash, 2004](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib8); [Reeder, 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib346)). Hb(III) reacts with H2O2 to form an oxyferryl cationic radical and a globin radical. Then, the globin radical can be transferred to other (macro)molecules such as lipoproteins and cell membrane [lipids](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/lipid "Learn more about lipids from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") thus causing cell damage and tissue injury. In addition, the globin radical can induce [amino acid](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/amino-acids "Learn more about amino acid from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") oxidation and globin cross-linking, Hb subunit dissociation and heme release. Overall, these events inhibit the Hb(III) clearance with the consequent accumulation of toxic Hb degradation products ([Jia et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib219); [Buehler et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib83)).

Hp binds Hb close to the heme group thus stabilizing this protein region and preventing heme release ([Bunn and Jandl, 1968](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib85); [Jeney et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib218); [Andersen et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib15); [Lipiski et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib268); [Lane-Serff et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib246), [2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib247); [Mollan et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib292); [Stodkilde et al., 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib397)). In fact, the heme is an hydrophobic molecule that cannot persist in a monomeric soluble status under physiological conditions. However, heme can be transferred from ferric Hb to low-affinity heme-binding proteins (_e.g._, albumin, lipoproteins, membrane-based proteins and lipids), in which heme is not stably located within the heme pocket as in the classic heme proteins such as Hb or [myoglobin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/myoglobin "Learn more about myoglobin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Bunn and Jandl, 1968](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib85); [Gattoni et al., 1996](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib170); [Miller and Shaklai, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib289); [Ascenzi and Fasano, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib26); [Fanali et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib155)). Such “unstable” location of the heme within low-affinity heme acceptors can trigger lipid peroxidation ([Balla et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib50)), lipoprotein oxidation ([Nagy et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib304); [Schaer et al., 2013a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib366), [2013b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib367)), and an overall increased oxidative stress. Notably, Hb(III) do not accumulate in plasma even under severe hemolytic conditions and the heme release from Hb is not a common event during intravascular hemolysis ([Baek et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib48)). On the other side, the Hp:Hb complex undergoes a slow and saturable clearance, which allows the Hp:Hb(III) complex to accumulate and to reach high non-toxic concentrations in plasma ([Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)).

Binding of Hb to Hp does not appear to inhibit completely the oxidative properties of the heme group and consequently radicals are still formed within the Hp:Hb complex ([Buehler et al., 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib83); [Vallelian et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib423)). However, Hb residues prone to oxidation are located at the Hp:Hb interface and the protective role of Hp may be achieved through shielding and stabilizing radicals on Hb ([Andersen et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib15); [Banerjee et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib54); [Alayash et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib9); [Cooper et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib112)). In particular, Hb residues Tyr42α and Cys93β representing a way for radical's migration from α1Hb to β2Hb (or from α2Hb to β1Hb) are located in close proximity in tetrameric Hb ([Pimenova et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib333)). Accordingly, Hp limits radical migration within Hb by preventing the association of the Hb tetramer ([Andersen et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib15)).

Besides the prevention of oxidative stress, the removal of Hb by Hp limits the amount of circulating iron creating an iron-poor environment that impairs pathogen growth ([Eaton et al., 1982](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib143); [Barclay, 1985](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib56); [Kasvosve et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib228); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)). As a case, iron plays a key role also in viral infections and elevated [ferritin](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/ferritin "Learn more about ferritin from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") concentrations are strongly associated with an earlier mortality in HIV ([McDermid et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib283); [Drakesmith and Prentice, 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib141); [Kasvosve et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib228)).

The ability of Hp to reduce the tissue-damaging effects of free radicals is genotype-dependent. Although all three genotypes (_i.e._, Hp1-1, Hp2-1, and Hp2-2) display the same [binding affinity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/binding-affinity "Learn more about binding affinity from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for Hb, Hp1-1 has a greater capacity to protect against oxidative damage ([Koda et al., 1998](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib240); [Melamed-Frank et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib285)). This reflects the different accessibility of the Hp molecule to the extravascular space. Indeed, as Hp2-1 or Hp2-2 have a higher molecular size and are consequently excluded from the extravascular space, individuals expressing these allelic variants of Hp may have higher levels of free Hb in circulation for a protracted period of time and thus may be exposed to a greater oxidative stress ([Melamed-Frank et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib285)). Notably, the Hp2-2 genotype is considered to be a major susceptibility condition for patients with type 2 diabetes because it results in reduced antioxidant capacity ([Amiri et al., 2013](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib13)).
### Haptoglobin immunoregulatory function

Hp is an [acute phase plasma protein](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/acute-phase-protein "Learn more about acute phase plasma protein from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([Kristiansen et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib244); [Wang et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib436); [Levy et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib259); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)) that can act either as an anti-inflammatory modulator or as a pro-inflammatory activator during the inflammatory response ([Arredouani et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib22), [2005](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib23); [Huntoon et al., 2008](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib210); [Shen et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib373)). In fact, Hp suppresses T [cell proliferation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/cell-proliferation "Learn more about cell proliferation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and regulates the balance between T helper-1 (Th1) cells (which produce IL-2 and IFN-γ and induce strong IgG responses, thus favoring the cellular immune response), and T helper-2 (Th2) cells (which produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 and increase IgE production, thereby mediating a predominantly humoral and eosinophilic response). In particular, Hp promotes Th1 cell proliferation and inhibits Th2 release, thus having a major effect on the susceptibility to infections ([Arredouani et al., 2003](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib22); [Guetta et al., 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib181); [Kasvosve et al., 2010](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib228)).

As mentioned in section [3.4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#sec3.4), Hp expression in modulated by IL-6, which in turn is induced by TNF-α and IL-1 ([Oliviero et al., 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib321); [Oliviero and Cortese, 1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib319); [Raynes et al., 1991](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib344); [Gabay and Kushner, 1999](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib164); [Yang et al., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib454); [Wang et al., 2001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib436); [Smeets et al., 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib380); [Andersen et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib16)). In turn, Hp inhibits gelatin deposition and modulates fibroblast migration, both events being necessary for wound healing and repair ([Gabay, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009829972030011X#bib163)).
#### Erniedrigtes Haptoglobin
from https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Haptoglobin
Haptoglobin ist der empfindlichste labordiagnostische [Marker](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Marker) einer [intravasalen Hämolyse](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Intravasale_H%C3%A4molyse) ([Hämolyseparameter](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/H%C3%A4molyseparameter)). Im Falle einer intravasalen [Hämolyse](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/H%C3%A4molyse) ist die Serumhaptoglobin-Konzentration auf Grund der Bindung von Hämoglobin stark erniedrigt. Die Hämolyse von 1-2 % der [Erythrozyten](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Erythrozyt) im Körper verbraucht das gesamte Haptoglobin. Die Serumkonzentration von Haptoglobin kann außerdem bei [Hämoglobinurien](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/H%C3%A4moglobinurie), [perniziöser Anämie](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Pernizi%C3%B6se_An%C3%A4mie), [EBV](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/EBV)-Infektionen, Patienten mit künstlichem [Herzklappenersatz](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/Herzklappenersatz) und bei sehr seltenen Erkrankungen (z.B. der [Ahaptoglobinämie](https://flexikon.doccheck.com/de/index.php?title=Ahaptoglobin%C3%A4mie&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ahaptoglobinämie (Artikel jetzt erstellen...)")) erniedrigt sein.
