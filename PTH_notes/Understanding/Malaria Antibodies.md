Yes, autoantibodies for erythrocytes in malaria are reported. Studies have shown that autoantibodies against erythrocytes are common in malaria, and high levels of these autoantibodies have been associated with severe anemia and reduced survival of non-infected red blood cells in patients with malaria[1][2][3]. The presence of these autoantibodies has been linked to the destruction of non-infected red blood cells, contributing to anemia in malaria infections[3][5].
