### Definition
No official standard diagnostic criteria for PADH but used as of now:
Patients develop ~7 days after treament with artesunates hemolytic anemia:
- for at least seven days:
	- >10% drop of Hb value
	- >10% increase of LDH value
	- very low / absent Haptoglobin value

### Epidemiology
PADH lower in patients from endemic regions
pfHRP2 protein test used to detect PADH: measures parasite proliferation and growth, as pfHRP2 is surface protein on infected and once infected erythrocytes so good marker for potential cells that die 
### Mechanism 
Part of the Hb drop and thus LDH rise explained with death of infected red blood cells other part with death of uninfected
**For infected the part:**
1. Pitting, as once infected Erys produced which have short life span ~7-21 days, when those die synchronous, the Hb drops 
**Unifinfected ideas:**
1. Artemisinin is an endoperoxide: first activated by intraparasitic heme-iron which catalyzes the cleavage of this endoperoxide. A resulting free radical intermediate may then kill the parasite by alkylating and poisoning one or more essential malarial protein(s). 
	This effect could possibly delay Erythropoiesis, by attacking precursor cells (named bone marrow suppression ) and reticulocytes in the blood and bone marrow (explaining the lowered Reti value at day 3) 
2. autoimmune hemolytic anemia: drug-anti drug immune complex formation #TODO what is that
